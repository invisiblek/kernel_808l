/** Initializes the provider and allocates a context for it.  If
    multiple providers of the same type are specified with different
    initialization info, this will be called for each of them. 

    The provider instance must keep track of any keys that it has
    announced using the notify callback, and deliver
    SSH_EK_EVENT_KEY_UNAVAILABLE notifications for any such keys if
    for example the smartcard on which they are stored is removed.

    When the provider calls the notify callback, the 'keypath'
    argument should only contain the part of the path that is
    interpreted by the provider. The generic code will prefix the path
    with the provider tag, and will remove the prefix whenever a path
    is passed to the provider.

    When this provider has been initialized (initialization may be an
    asynchronous operation), the notify callback should be called with
    event SSH_EK_EVENT_PROVIDER_ENABLED.  
    
    @return
    This returns a provider context, which is a private data type for 
    the provider type specified glue.  The provider_context_return is 
    passed to all of the other functions.
    
    The following error messages are defined:

    - SSH_EK_PROVIDER_INITIALIZATION_INFO_INVALID: fails because the
    initialization information given was invalid (DLL search path
    invalid, etc).

    - SSH_EK_PROVIDER_INITIALIZATION_FAILED: initialization failed for
    some other reason than the initialization information.

    The provider should not return any other error status codes.
