/* Platform-dependent cycle counters used for very detailed profiling.
   The purpose is to measure, with as little overhead as possible,
   very small differences in time, such as the execution of a few to a
   few hundred instructions.  This file is *not* intended for coarser
   profiling.

   The macro 'SSH_TICKS_READ32' assumes it is given an lvalue of type
   'SshUInt32', and 'SSH_TICKS_READ64' assumes it is given an lvalue
   of type 'SshUInt64'.  Should no suitable cycle counter be
   available, then 'SSH_TICKS_READ32' and 'SSH_TICKS_READ64'
   initialize their arguments to zero. */
