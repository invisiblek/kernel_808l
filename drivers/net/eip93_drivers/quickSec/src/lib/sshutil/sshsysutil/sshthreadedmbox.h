  This file contains definitions for the thread-safe message box
  concept, which is used to perform synchronization between the
  thread-unaware eloop and other code which is thread-aware.

  Notice: This API will work even if the environment does not support
  threads (all send_to_{thread,eloop} call the callback directly), if
  the code callings this is programmed correctly.
