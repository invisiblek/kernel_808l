   Description:

   The implementation of these functions is platform-dependent and can
   be found from the "interceptor" source code directory. The stub
   routines are located in the hwaccel_stubs.c file.


   * About implementing hardware accelerator drivers *

   There are two levels of possible hardware accelerator API
   abstractions

   1. The ipsec-transform
   2. The combined-transform

   The ipsec-transform (1) should be used when the accelerator chip
   does only the de/encryption and/or MAC calculation, eg. 3DES, SHA-1
   or MD5.

   The combined-transform (2) should only be used when the hardware
   accelerator does the entire IPsec transformation, including the
   ESP/AH/IPIP header and trailer processing for the packet.

   If you are writing a hardware accelerator from scratch, you will
   need to implement only a subset of the API functions described in
   this header, depending whether the driver implements (1) or (2).
   Other functions should return NULL (or should not be reached).

   The hardware acceleration operations are all totally controlled by
   Engine, so that when a call to the ssh_hwaccel_alloc_ipsec() (1) is
   made by Engine, the driver should setup a HW session with the
   chip and return an accelerator-specific hardware accelerator
   context.

   The call to ssh_hwaccel_alloc_ipsec() is followed by an arbitrary
   number of (0 - n) calls to the ssh_hwaccel_perform_ipsec()
   function. A packet is passed with this function call to the
   driver, which should process the packet 3DES, SHA-1, etc... and
   call the completion callback when finished.  The driver should
   implement the necessary queuing mechanisms or locking and the
   interrupt handling for the packets.

   (For PCI bus prototyping, there is a convenient API available for
   this purpose in the the ipsec/hwaccel/sshpcihw.h header file
   with implementations both for Linux 2.2, 2.4 and VxWorks 5.4
   various BSPs.)

   The session is destroyed by Engine when it calls the
   ssh_hwaccel_free() function. Engine implements reference
   counting so that there cannot be any packets in the accelerator
   driver when a call to this function is made. The driver should free
   all the resources related to this HW session allocated by the
   ssh_hwaccel_alloc_ipsec() call.

   Example drivers are available in the ipsec/hwaccel directory.

   Note: The configure time option "--with-hwaccel=[name]-[model]"
   enables the combined-transform level (2) hardware acceleration
   support in Engine, but only if needed by that particular driver.

/** Allocate a hardware acceleration context for combination of IPsec

    The 'flags' parameter determines whether the instance is to be
    used for decapsulation or encapsulation, as well as the types of
    transforms to perform. The order of transforms is fixed, in
    decryption order NATT-AH->ESP->IPcomp->IPIP (and reverse
    encryption order).

    The 'flags_return' parameter indicates which of the requested
    services were provided. Ones that were not provided need to be
    taken care at the software before/after the the combined transform
    has been applied, or the returned accelerated transform must be
    dropped.

    The {ah,esp,ipcomp,ipip}_ parameters should be used only if
    the relevant bit is set in the 'flags' bitmask.

    If using counter mode encryption, the cipher nonce is contained in
    the 'esp_iv' buffer. For cbc mode of encryption , 'esp_iv' should be
    ignored.

    If the `seq_num_low' is non-zero, the initial 32-bit ESP sequence
    number should be set to the value given by the parameter. If the
    hw-accelerator cannot set the initial ESP sequence number to the
    given value (other than zero) this function should return NULL. For
    64-bit seq-numbers the `seq_num_high' represents the higher 32 bits
    of the 64-bit sequence number. The `seq_num_high' should be ignored
    if the flag SSH_HWACCEL_COMBINED_FLAG_LONGSEQ is not set.

    If the flag SSH_HWACCEL_COMBINED_FLAG_NATT is set, NAT traversal
    encapsulation as defined in RFC 3948 should be performed. The
    destination port in the UDP header is 'natt_remote_port', the source
    port is always 4500. If transport mode is being used, then the original
    addresses used for updating upper layer checksums are encoded in
    'natt_oa_l' and 'natt_oa_r'. The number of bytes in 'natt_oa_l' and
    'natt_oa_r' is 16 for IPv6 and 4 for IPv4. */

/** Perform hardware-accelerated processing for an IPsec

    the transform.  The hardware acceleration context 'accel' stores
    the algorithms, keys, and other relevant information for processing
    the individual packets.  The hardware acceleration context also
    specifies whether encryption or decryption is to be performed.

    On chips that store multiple contexts directly on the chip (e.g.,
    multiple key schedules and IVs), the hardware acceleration context
    may contain an index to the appropriate hardware context.  The
    software implementing this API must manage the loading and
    offloading of contexts to/from the hardware.

    Conceptually this function arranges for 'pp' to be freed.
    Typically this happens by calling the completion function, which
    will arrange for the packet to be eventually freed. Calling the
    completion function is always mandatory; if the packet is freed in
    this function, then the completion function must be called with
    NULL as the packet.

    If the hardware is capable of generating the IV, it should place the
    IV in the first cipher block at the offset specified by
    'encrypt_iv_offset'. If the hardware is not capable of generating a
    unpredictable IV, an acceptable alternative is to generate the IV by
    encrypting the first cipher block at the offset specified by
    'encrypt_iv_offset'. It is guaranteed that this cipher block is
    unique for each packet and it contains some weak entropy, thus
    encrypting this block will give a unpredictable IV.

    The callback function can be called either immediately before this
    function returns, or at some later time asynchronously with other
    operations.  However, it must be called at an execution level
    compatible with the rest of the code used in the TCP/IP stack and
    the packet processing Engine to ensure that concurrency control
    assumptions in the rest of the code are not violated.
