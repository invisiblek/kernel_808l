    <!-- username and password for EAP authentication.
         Note that the username is identical to the local identity in
         the tunnel "host-to-host" below. In IKEv2, the EAP server should 
         not send EAP identity requests to the client when performing EAP 
         authentication as the client has already sent its identity in the 
         first IKE_AUTH message. The identity the client will use in 
         IKE_AUTH message is the tunnel's local identity. If the EAP server
         does send an EAP identity request, the client will respond to the EAP 
         identity request with the username as configured in the client-auth 
         block below. In any case, the password is used for md5-challenge
         authentication.
         EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA do not use the password at all because
         authentication secrets are stored in a SIM/USIM card. If the server
         sends an EAP identity request, the username configured here is used
         by EAP-SIM or EAP-AKA as follows: if the username is complete, e.g.
         "user@domain" then that username is used unchanged. If it contains
         a domain only, e.g. "@domain" then the IMSI is obtained from the
         SIM/USIM card, prefixed with "1" (EAP-SIM) or "0" (EAP-AKA) and the
         domain part is appended to it to form the final username, for example
         "0555444333222111@domain". If no username is configured here then
         the prefixed IMSI is used without any domain part. -->
