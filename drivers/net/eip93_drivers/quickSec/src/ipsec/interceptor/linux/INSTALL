Installing Linux 2.x Packet Interceptor
---------------------------------------



Linux-2.6
-------------
    
   The packet interceptor attaches itself to the Netfilter's hooks.
   You need to compile Linux 2.6.x kernel with following options
   selected:

       * Network packet filtering (CONFIG_NETFILTER)

   Kernel requires these options and Interceptor will not work unless
   firewall support is compiled into the kernel.

   IPv6 support does not require any changes in the kernel to work.
   However, if you compile IPv6 support - The IPv6 protocol (CONFIG_IPV6) -
   as a module, you HAVE to load the module BEFORE installing the
   interceptor.



Compiling
---------

   Before compiling the Quicksec toolkit, make sure that the linux kernel
   headers in /usr/include/linux are compatible with the target kernel 
   headers.

   There are two alternative ways for compiling the linux interceptor module:

   1) The normal compilation:

      ./configure && make

      This will compile the quicksec.ko and quicksec_usermode.ko modules
      with default compiler options. Extra options can be specified using
      the environment variables CFLAGS and KERN_CFLAGS. The resulting
      modules are in ipsec/interceptor/linux/.

   2) The kbuild compilation:
      
      ./configure && make
      cd ipsec/interceptor/linux/; make kbuild/Makefile; cd kbuild; make

      This will compile the quicksec.ko and quicksec_usermode.ko modules
      with compiler flags that were used for compiling the linux kernel.
      The resulting modules are in ipsec/interceptor/linux/kbuild/.

      Note that before compiling the modules using the kbuild compilation,
      the toolkit must be first configured and compiled the normal way.

   The kbuild compiled modules should be preferred on all x86_64 platforms,
   on montavista linux and on montavista mobilinux.



Installation
------------

   1.  Load Interceptor into the kernel.

       On linux-2.6:
       /sbin/insmod ./quicksec.ko

       For optional insmod parameters, see README or output of 
       '/sbin/modinfo quicksec.ko'.

   2.  Create a new configuration file or edit an existing one (eg. 
       quicksec.xml).

   3.  Start the Policy Manager.

       ./quicksecpm

       or if special configuration file is created (other than
       quicksec.xml) use command:

       ./quicksecpm -f <configfile>



Uninstalling
------------

   Interceptor module maybe unloaded at any time from the system.  Module
   can be unloaded with command:

       /sbin/rmmod quicksec

   
   However, it must be noted that the Policy Manager cannot be running
   at the same time when unloading the module.  Modules usage count must
   be set to zero by stopping the Policy Manager.  After this the module
   may be unloaded from the kernel.

   To see if the Packet Interceptor is currently loaded into the kernel
   use command:

       /sbin/lsmod



Run-time statistics
-------------------

   The packet interceptor provides run-time statistics of the network
   traffic passed through the interceptor. This statistics is available
   in the /proc filesystem. Other information is also available from the
   /proc filesystem. The following files are available:

       * /proc/quicksec/statistics

           Provides statistics of the interceptor.  Use command
           `cat /proc/quicksec/statistics´ to view the statistics.

       * /proc/quicksec/version

           Shows the version of the Packet Interceptor and the IPsec
           Engine.  Use command `cat /proc/quicksec/version´ to view 
           the version.

       * /proc/quicksec/debug

           Present only on debug builds. Can be used for setting the	
	   kernel debug string. Use for example command 
	   `echo "*Interceptor*=99" > /proc/quicksec/debug´ to set
	   the debug string.

   There are other files as well, however, they are only used by the
   Policy Manager and should not be touched otherwise.
